## A day/week/monthly calendar component for React

Currently only displays events and lacks click callbacks

## Demo

An interactive demo can be viewed at: http://nathan.stitt.org/dayz/  It lacks polish but is somewhat functional ;)



### Development

- `npm start` starts up a local development webserver which rebuilds files when changed
- `npm test` runs unit tests
- `npm run build` compiles files in preparation for publishing
